### 👨‍💻 About Me:
I'm David Rodriguez, and I'm obsessed with efficiency and eliminating stress. Everything that bores business owners and makes work feel like work? Yeah, that's what computers are for, and making them do it is my favorite thing ever.

Want me to do that for you? I'd be delighted. Let's connect!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on fully local deployments of LLMs with my eye on blended local/api driven MoE agents
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more Python and more cloud DevOps.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on everything to St Louis area community development projects to employee onboarding systems. If it's nerdy and good for the world, hit me up!
- 💬 Ask me about gut health and foraged foods! But only if you're in a comfortable chair with some time on your hands. 🤓
- 📫 How to reach me: david@windrose.dev
- 😄 Pronouns: He, Him, His (But I honestly identify more as a carbon-based, simian-formatted LLM deployment.)
- ⚡ Fun fact: Before becoming a dev, I've been a flatbed long haul trucker, comanager of a half million dollar a year violin business, a private investigator, and a personal trainer. I probably understand your customers better than you might think. 😁
